# Action Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

* From overgrown jungle temples to glowing rooftops in midnight metropolises, the world is a carousel of danger and wonder. Every place hides a secret — a clue, a curse, or a man with a silenced gun.
* Time flexes but never rests. The jazz-fueled 1930s, the shadowy tension of the Cold War, the chaotic now — every era is ripe for action, intrigue, and impossible choices.
* The world is always in motion: storm-lashed islands, dust-choked bazaars, sunken tombs beneath crowded cities, snowbound monasteries — each locale a ticking bomb of forgotten stories.
* History never sleeps. Ancient dynasties, lost cults, whispered prophecies, and banned documents smolder beneath the surface, waiting to resurface in fire or fraud.
* Cultures collide and tangle — scholars, criminals, wanderers, soldiers — chasing truth, gold, vengeance, or something stranger, always on unfamiliar soil.
* Technology is the drumbeat of the chase. Sometimes it’s radios and revolvers; other times, drones and digital vaults. The gear changes, but the tension is timeless.
* Borders mean nothing to ambition. Behind every checkpoint lies a dying empire, a buried war, a boardroom coup, or a quiet coup in progress.
* In the end, it’s always about the pursuit — the artifact, the person, the revelation — and the price you're willing to pay to reach it.

## Special Rules

### Action Points

Each character begins an adventure with **3 Action Points (AP)**. These do **not refresh** and cannot normally be regained. AP represent the character’s inner reserve of **focus, resolve, and tactical brilliance** — the kind of instinct that flips the scene from disaster to legend.

#### Spending AP

At any moment, you may spend **1 Action Point** to:

* **Gain Advantage**: You roll with edge, no matter what tags or odds say.
* **Cancel a Failure**: Turn a failed roll into a *success with a cost*.
* **Avoid a Consequence**: Dodge harm, exposure, or narrative fallout.
* **Do the Impossible**: Pull off something daring, cinematic, and untagged — sliding under a trapdoor, mid-air grappling hook, bluffing your way past a kill team. You succeed *with style*.

> \[TIP]
> Action Points are best spent when the scene demands momentum, not logic. Ask yourself: *Would this make a great moment?* If yes, spend.

### Push Yourself (Regain 1 AP)

Once per adventure, you may **Push Yourself** to regain 1 Action Point — but it comes at a cost. Choose one:

* **Take a Serious Consequence** — injury, exposure, lost trust, or something broken.
* **Burn a Tag** — a piece of gear or a trait is marked unusable for the rest of the adventure.
* **Escalate the Situation** — make the scene worse: reinforcements arrive, the room floods, the item is a decoy, etc.

> \[CAUTION]
> This isn’t a reset button — it’s a red flag to the fiction. Push when the moment feels *big*, and be ready for the fallout.

Great. This version of the factions reads like placeholders from a 90s Indiana Jones game. Nothing *wrong* per se — but they lack:

* **Distinct tone**: many overlap conceptually (Adventurers vs Archaeologists?).
* **Modern ambiguity**: too many "good vs evil" pairs.
* **Relevance to your premise**: the global, genre-hopping tension isn’t well-reflected.
* **Style**: names like "Military Expedition" or "The Adventurers’ Guild" feel uninspired for this setting.
