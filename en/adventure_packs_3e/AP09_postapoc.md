# Post-Apocalyptic Adventure Pack

## Setting Information

- The world died fifty years ago when the Eden Protocol failed — a biotech energy system meant to end scarcity instead ruptured, flooding the atmosphere with mutagenic particles and radiation no suit could stop.
- The setting is North America’s heartland — the old Midwest — now a scarred landscape of ash-choked forests, bone-dry riverbeds, and ruins half-swallowed by creeping vines that glow at night.
- Cities lie cracked and hollow, their cores too toxic to enter without shielding. Rural zones fare little better — twisted by fallout storms, plagued by beasts that once were cattle, wolves, or people.
- Survivors cling to the margins — makeshift settlements in old silos, cave networks rigged with solar foil, rail depots turned into barter forts. Nothing is safe, but some places are quieter than others.
- Society is shattered into fragments — scavenger bands, trade clans, poison cults, and survivalist militias — each clinging to power by hoarding fuel, clean water, or working tech from before the collapse.
- Trade is blood and risk — vaccines for bullets, batteries for meat, clean water for everything. Currency is whatever keeps you breathing one more day.
- Technology is half-magic and half-dead — patched drones, solar rigs, hand-pumped railcars, and relics scavenged from zones no sane person enters twice.
- Radiation is not just poison — it breeds new ecologies, new instincts, new terrors. The land mutates, and those who walk it too long often change with it.

## Special Rules

### The Eden Fallout

Radiation isn’t just background noise — it’s the air you breathe, the dust on your skin, and the voice in your blood. Any time your Protagonist lingers in a red zone, digs into old biotech ruins, or crosses a fallout storm, **ask the Oracle**: *Does the exposure leave a mark?*

* A **Yes** means you gain a temporary or permanent **Mutation Tag**.
* A **No, but…** may mean sickness, weakness, or hallucinations.
* Treatments are rare and unreliable. When you attempt to treat radiation symptoms, **ask the Oracle** if the method is effective — most “cures” are pre-Collapse myths or poison in a vial.

> **NOTE**
> *Mutation Tags* should reflect the unnatural evolution of life in the wasteland.
> Examples: `Bioluminescent Veins`, `Bone Bark Armor`, `Photosynthetic Skin`, `Echo Sense`.

### Survival at the Brink

Resources are not tracked — they’re **story drivers**. You have what you need *until the world says you don’t*. Whenever your character uses up food, water, fuel, or ammo in a risky context, **ask the Oracle**: *Do you still have enough?*

* If the answer is **No**, narrate what went wrong — spoiled rations, burst canisters, power drains — and improvise a new plan.
* Certain Tags (like `Scavenger Instinct` or `Jury-Rigged Solar Still`) may give you Advantage.

> **EXAMPLE**
> You fire your last flare into the night, hoping to blind the oncoming beast.
> Ask the Oracle: *Do I have more flares?*
> *No* — and the pack is already circling.

### Faction Instability

No one rules the Wastes — but many try. When you interact with a faction (militias, trade caravans, cults, etc.), **ask the Oracle**: *How do they respond?*

* Consider your Tags and theirs. If you're branded by a rival clan, expect hostility.
* Roll again if the faction is internally split or operating under stress — betrayal and negotiation often go hand in hand.

> **NOTE**
> *Faction Tags* are optional but useful.
> Examples: `Water Tithers`, `Bullet Gospel Evangelists`, `Sunfoil Syndicate`, `Cracked Dome Alliance`.

> **EXAMPLE**
> You meet a trader with a Sunfoil armband and offer them half your ammo for clean water.
> Ask the Oracle: *Do they agree?*
> *Yes, and —* they warn you of a nearby fallout storm for free.
