# Cog & Compass

***Cog & Compass*** is a solo tabletop RPG adventure set in a world powered by steam and clockwork. Take on the role of a daring inventor tinkering with wondrous automata, a fearless airship captain navigating treacherous skies, or a cunning rogue navigating the bustling underbelly of smog-choked cities.

This minimalist system uses only dice and your imagination. Ask closed-ended questions to an "Oracle" (a system of interpreting dice rolls) to shape your story and uncover intriguing mysteries within the Cog & Compass Era. Be prepared for unexpected twists –  the ever-turning gears of fate may surprise you at every turn!

## Introduction

*Cog & Compass* follows the following design principles:

1. **Portable**: to play you will need a few common (six-sided) dice and writing materials. Anything else is optional and not essential.
2. **Rules-Light**: the game relies on a few rules and only one solving mechanic, easy to learn and eventually to memorize.
3. **Tag-based**: characters and situations are defined only by qualitative descriptors and no quantitative characteristics.

With a focus on quick resolutions, **Cog & Compass** throws you headfirst into the heart of the action. Your character will be defined by thematic tags, allowing you to craft a hero that perfectly embodies the spirit of the age - be it a "Brilliant Engineer" or a "Cunning Spymaster."

### What is a Role Playing Game (RPG)?
A role-playing game (RPG) is a type of game in which players assume the roles of fictional characters and act out their actions and decisions within a narrative or imaginary setting. The outcome of these actions and decisions is often determined by a set of rules and game mechanics, such as dice rolls or statistical attributes of the characters. Players may also collaborate to create a shared story or narrative through their characters' actions and interactions.

### What is a Solo RPG?

In a solo RPG a single player takes on the roles of one or more characters, while also simultaneously managing some elements of the game world. These games typically involve the use of a rule system and game mechanics to determine the outcome of actions taken by the player-controlled characters. 
Unlike a gamebook (such as the Fighting Fantasy, Lone Wolf, and Tunnels & Trolls series) a solo RPG is not a form of interactive, forked narrative in which outcomes are pre-determined and limited by the author's choices.

Through the interaction of player, oracle, tools, and prompts, the character's actions will build an **emergent narrative** within whose boundaries anything can be attempted, without predetermined limits.

### Safety Tools
You will play alone, but be sure to play in an environment that is comfortable for you, without overexerting yourself, and reserve the option to stop as soon as you feel uncomfortable for any reason, physical or emotional. Don't be afraid to tackle new themes, but do so in full awareness of your boundaries.

### Minimum Requirements
To play *Cog & Compass* you will need:
- **4 six sided dice** (also known as d6s): two pairs of different colors
- **Paper and writing tools**: at least a sheet of scrap paper and and pencil, but index cards or sticky notes are a fine addition
- **Character sheet**: you may use the provided sheet at the back or a simple index card.
- **Notebook**: *Cog & Compass* is not a solo journaling game, you can easily play it in the "theater of mind". But you can keep track of you game if you feel the need!

## Characters

Before you venture up into the skies, over the seas, or across the lands of the Cog & Compass era, let's see how to manage your Protagonist and other characters.

### Everything is a Character!

In *Cog & Compass* Non-Playing Characters (NPCs), Foes, Organizations, Monsters, and even relevant objects like vehicles are characters too!

Your Protagonist is described by some fixed traits:

- **Name**: The name should be iconic and consistent with the tone and setting of the story.
- **Concept**: A concise description of the character's profession, background, and abilities. The best are adjective-name pairings, like *"Venturous Smuggler"* or *"Child Prodigy"*.
- **Skills** (x2): Abilities not necessarily character-specific but not characteristics common to all. *"Smart"* is not a skill, *"Engine Whisperer"* is.
- **Frailty**: Something that could potentially get in the way of the character, either physically, mentally, or socially.
- **Gear** (x2): Particular equipment supplied to the character in coherence with the setting. Everyday items are taken for granted and do not fall under this trait.
- **Goal**: The long-term objective.
- **Motive**: What drives the pursuit of the goal.
- **Nemesis**: A person or organization that hinders the protagonist. It can emerge during the first game sessions, it may or may or not be the direct antagonist of the story, ready to appear to make life even more difficult
- **Luck**: The measure of a character's ability to avoid ill fortune or an inauspicious outcome. It applies only in Conflicts and automatically recharges when they end. Luck starts and caps at 6.

These **traits** are described by **tags**, descriptive words or phrases that can identify anything in the game world. Even the **details** of the environment in which the action moves and **conditions** (physical or mental) of the characters are tags. 

**They are qualitative representations. They are not quantitative measures.**

## Rules

*Cog & Compass* is a minimalist Solo Role Playing Game designed to be played with only one character (the Protagonist). You'll guide them through the story that will unravel during the game, asking closed questions to an Oracle which will help you overturn your expectations.

Every now and then you will be surprised with an unexpected twist!

### Keep The Action In Motion

A game in *Cog & Compass* is a succession of scenes. 
A scene is a unit of time in which a certain action takes place in pursuit of a certain short-term goal. 

In *Cog & Compass* at each scene:
1. **Identify what you expect from the scene**. Compared to traits, goal, and motivation determine the Protagonist's action. What might be the reaction of the game world?
2. **Test your expectations**. When you are uncertain (or overconfident) about the reaction to your actions, [ask the Oracle](#consulting-the-oracle) a closed question (answer is Yes or No), considering the tags involved to determine if there is an [Advantage or Disadvantage](#advantage-and-disadvantage).
3. **Interpret the result**. Is the Oracle's answer in line with your expectations? If not, in the context in which the scene takes place, how should an answer that subverts them be considered?

This sequence will come to you naturally after some practice. Use it as a guideline the first few times.

### Consulting the Oracle

When you need to test your expectations you'll ask the Oracle a closed question.

You’ll need 2d6 in one color (**Chance Dice**), and 2d6 in another (**Risk Dice**).

To resolve a closed question, roll one **Chance Die** and one **Risk Die**:
- If the Chance Die is highest, the answer is **Yes**. 
- If the Risk Die is highest, the answer is **No**.
- If both are low (3 or less), add a **but...**. 
- If both are high (4 or more), add an **and...**.
- If both are equal, the answer is **Yes, and...**. Add a point to the **[Twist Counter](#twist-counter)**.


| Dice Value |    Chance Die > Risk Die   | Risk Die > Chance Die |
|:----------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|
|  Both < 4  |         Yes, but...        |       No, but...      |
|  Both > 3  |         Yes, and...        |       No, and...      |
| Mismatched |             Yes            |           No          |
|            |                            |                       |
|    Equal   | Add 1 to the Twist Counter |                       |

### Advantage and Disadvantage

If circumstances or positive tags grant an advantage, add a **Chance Die** to the roll. Otherwise, when hindrances or negative tag cause a disadvantage, add a **Risk Die**. In both cases keep only the higher die of the added type when you check the roll.

Consider tags **intuitively and not quantitatively**, using the context of the situation at play. It is important to keep the flow of play fast and not accounting for advantages and disadvantages numerically!

### Twist Counter

The Twist Counter is a measure of the rising tension in the narrative. At the beginning is set to 0. Every time a double throw (dice are equal) happens, add 1 to the Counter. If the Counter is below three, consider the answer as "**Yes, but...**". Otherwise a **Twist** happens and resets the Counter.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following Twist Table to determine what kind of twist happens. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

### Steam Resonance

In this world, characters have a refined sensitivity to the mechanics and flow of steam technology. They possess a "Steam Resonance" (SR) score that quantifies their proficiency and connection with steam-powered devices. This affinity allows characters to perform enhanced actions with technology, but careful management is necessary to avoid the dangers of overheating.

- **Starting Score**: Each character begins with a Steam Resonance score of 6, reflecting their innate ability to interface with steam technology.
- **Using Steam Resonance**: SR can be utilized to amplify physical actions, operate complex steam-driven machinery, or execute unique technological skills specific to each character.
- **Enhanced Actions**: To enhance an action using SR, a player expends one SR point and rolls a die. If the result exceeds their current SR score, the character's device overheats, resulting in negative consequences and failure of the action. If the result is lower or equal, the action succeeds with added benefits (advantage).
- **Recovery of SR Points**: SR points are gradually regained through rest or by spending time in steam-rich environments. Characters naturally recover one SR point per day. Additional recovery methods might involve specific gear or settings designed to quickly rejuvenate steam affinity.

### Smog Exposure

The pervasive smog that blankets industrial areas in this world poses significant risks. This dense air pollution, a byproduct of the widespread reliance on steam and coal, can severely impact health and hinder navigation.

- **Effects of Smog**: Characters exposed to smog without appropriate protection may experience several detrimental effects:
  - **Reduced Visibility**: Thick smog decreases visibility, complicating combat and exploration activities.
  - **Respiratory Issues**: Prolonged exposure can diminish stamina and overall health due to the inhalation of toxic particulates.
  - **Cognitive Impairments**: Some may suffer from disorientation or hallucinations, affecting decision-making or causing them to see illusions.

- **Protective Measures**:
  - **Gear**: Utilizing items like gas masks or air filtration devices can lessen or neutralize the effects of smog. 
  - **Antidotes and Treatments**: Certain concoctions or medical treatments can alleviate the symptoms caused by smog exposure.
  - **Advanced Equipment**: Crafting or acquiring high-quality protective gear provides stronger resistance or even immunity to specific penalties associated with smog.

- **Navigational and Quest Challenges**:
  - **Traverse Smoggy Areas**: Characters must either prepare thoroughly (e.g., ensuring sufficient protective gear and antidotes) or find alternative pathways to avoid the worst of the smog.
  - **Unique Quest Opportunities**: Smoggy zones can be the setting for diverse missions—investigating the source of the smog, initiating cleanup operations, or rescuing inhabitants and workers suffering from severe smog exposure.

### Conflicts

A *Conflict* is any situation in which opponents clash, attacking, defending, or wearing each other down in order to win.
This applies both in a practical and metaphorical sense. 

So, a Conflict is not only limited to combat (or fighting) in the strict sense but also to competitive situations (such as contests, duels, verbal confrontations, etc.) in which two or more characters (including vehicles, of course!) compete.

Conflicts can be resolved in different ways depending on preferences and context:
1. Ask a single closed question. The Oracle's answer determines the outcome of the conflict.
2. Ask a series of closed questions to resolve current single actions.
3. Use the rules of Harm & Luck below.

Note that the Twist Counter **does not apply** to Harm & Luck. Instead, it is used regularly if the Conflict is handled with closed questions.

If the conflict is resolved by applying damage to the Luck trait, roll the dice to determine whether the protagonist causes damage to the opponent or suffers damage due to counterattack or failed defense. The rolls are player facing only.

The damage reduces the Luck of the target, whether protagonist or NPC. When the Luck runs out, the character has lost the conflict.

The final outcome depends on the context. Do you get caught? Are you seriously injured? You may even die if that fits the narrative.

| Answer      | Do you get what you want?                               | Harm    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |

| Yes, but... | You get what you want, but at a cost.                   | Cause 1 |
| No, but...  | You don’t get what you want, but it’s not a total loss. | Take 1  |
| No...       | You don’t get what you were after.                      | Take 2  |
| No, and...  | You don’t get what you want, and things get worse.      | Take 3  |

### Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene sometimes you will be clear about the direction to take, other times you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

- A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
- During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
- A **meanwhile scene** takes place somewhere else, other than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

### Open-Ended Question or Get Inspired

To answer an Open-Ended question, roll 1d6 once on each of the following tables (roll at least a verb and a noun, adjectives are optional).

### When the story ends

At the end of the adventure you may add another trait to the character. It is better that this is related to how the story just ended and can be either a Skill, Gear, a new Frailty, or even a new Nemesis! You can also modify an existing trait to better represent an enhanced expertise.

Also update the list of **NPCs**, **Locations**, and **Events** that may show up again in future adventures.

## Clockwork Augmentations

Characters can enhance their abilities through clockwork augmentations. These range from steam-powered limbs that increase strength to cog-driven optics that sharpen perception. However, over-dependence on augmentations might result in the loss of organic abilities.

1. **Cogspring Legs**: Increases a character's speed and jump height, enabling breathtaking leaps or rapid sprints over short distances.

2. **Steamfist Gauntlets**: Enhances strength, allowing for devastating punches capable of bending metal or shattering stone.

3. **Opti-Gear Eyes**: Grants superior vision, including the ability to zoom or see in low light conditions, making the wearer an exceptional scout or sniper.

4. **Gearwork Wings**: A pair of mechanical wings that enable short-duration flight or extended gliding, perfect for reaching elevated places or making dramatic entrances.

5. **Pneumatic Arms**: Provide immense lifting capacity and crushing power, ideal for heavy labor or breaking through barriers.

6. **Vocal Modulator**: Allows the user to mimic any voice heard previously or amplify their own, useful for deception or commanding attention.

7. **Chrono-Link Bracelet**: Enhances reaction time to near-instantaneous levels for a few seconds, simulating a brief period of perceived time dilation.

8. **Echo-Locator Ears**: Sonar-based augmentation granting echolocation, enabling navigation and detection of objects or beings through solid walls or in complete darkness.

9. **Smoke Filtration Lungs**: Offer protection against smog, gas attacks, and respiratory toxins, filtering out harmful particles and converting them into breathable air.

10. **Auto-Repairing Skin**: A mesh of fine clockwork and nanogears beneath the skin that gradually repairs wounds, reducing healing time.

11. **Wind-Up Heart**: A backup heart that kicks in if the original fails, providing a second chance at life in dire circumstances.

12. **Gyro-Balanced Core**: Improves balance and agility, allowing the user to perform acrobatic feats or maintain their footing in combat on uneven terrain.

13. **Steam-Boosted Sensors**: Heighten all five senses, offering superhuman perception that can detect subtle changes in a person's heartbeat or track quarry by scent alone.

14. **Circuit-Weave Brain**: Enhances cognitive functions with clockwork precision, boosting problem-solving abilities, calculation speed, and overall mental acuity.

15. **Hydraulic Crunch Claws**: Replace the hands with powerful clamps capable of crushing or manipulating heavy objects, while retaining fine motor control for delicate tasks.

16. **Mnemonic Storage Drive**: Implanted in the brain, this device significantly increases memory capacity and recall speed, making the user a walking library of information.

17. **Pressure-Powered Jump Boots**: These rugged, steam-driven boots utilize high-pressure steam bursts to allow for explosive leaps, enabling characters to navigate treacherous terrains or overcome obstacles with ease. Perfect for quick escapes or reaching difficult places.

18. **Cognitive Gear Processor**: This sophisticated clockwork mechanism is integrated into the cerebral cortex, enhancing decision-making speeds and providing a tactical edge by calculating multiple probabilities and outcomes in real-time, akin to a human chess computer.

## Cogwork Familiars

Characters can have cogwork animal companions. These steam-powered familiars can assist in various tasks, from scouting to combat. Players need to manage their familiars' steam reserves and perform maintenance.

- Players can design their cogwork familiars, choosing from various animal forms that offer different abilities. For example, a cogwork owl could provide enhanced vision for scouting, while a cogwork wolf might offer combat support.
- Familiars require steam to operate. Their steam reserves deplete with use and must be replenished through specific resources or by resting in a steam-enriched environment.
- Regular maintenance is required to keep familiars operational. Neglect could lead to malfunctions or decreased efficiency in tasks.
- Players can upgrade their familiars with parts obtained from quests, crafting, or trade, enhancing their abilities or adding new functions.
