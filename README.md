**Loner** is a minimalist solo game that will allow you to have amazing adventures in any genre and setting with two pairs of dice and only your imagination as the limit!

Based on [Freeform Universal](https://www.perilplanet.com/freeform-universal/), this revised second edition is the result of player feedback and is designed to introduce even the neophyte to solo RPG.

Complete with tips, diagrams and examples, you can dive into endless worlds of adventure in a few minutes.

Explore them with your Protagonist through the Oracle-led emergent narrative and be amazed by the unexpected twists and turns.

## License

I strongly support the open source ethos.

**Loner** is based on some materials released under a Creative Commons license and likewise is distributed under a **CC-BY-SA-4.0** license: use it, hack it, make your own edition! 

The more we spread this logic of sharing and reciprocity the more widespread and free our hobby will become.
