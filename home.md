## Another Solo RPG

© 2023 Roberto Bisceglie

> *Tonight your playgroup couldn't get together and you're dying to play?*  
> *Or you may not even have a group or maybe you don't even want to have one!*  
> *Good news: solo roleplaying is possible!*

**Loner** is a minimalist solo game that will allow you to have amazing adventures in any genre and setting with two pairs of dice and only your imagination as the limit!

Based on [Freeform Universal](https://www.perilplanet.com/freeform-universal/), this revised second edition is the result of player feedback and is designed to introduce even the neophyte to solo RPG.

Complete with tips, diagrams and examples, you can dive into endless worlds of adventure in a few minutes.

Explore them with your Protagonist through the Oracle-led emergent narrative and be amazed by the unexpected twists and turns.

            <h2><b>Cog & Compass</b></h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Cog & Compass Era, a time when steam technology reshapes the 19th century into a landscape brimming with mechanical marvels and industrial wonders. In this richly detailed steampunk universe, you are the protagonist in a world defined by gears, pistons, and the hiss of steam engines.            
            </p>
            <p>
                From the smog-choked cities of industrial magnates to the uncharted territories guarded by steam-powered automatons, your journey will take you through a reimagined Victorian era like no other. Commandeer airships that traverse the skies, navigate mighty steamboats across churning rivers, or pilot rugged steam crawlers over landscapes that stretch the limits of the imagination.

            <h2><b>Legends of Camelot</b></h2>
            <p>
                Step into the mythic realm of Camelot, where chivalric knights uphold their codes, mystical creatures roam the wilds, and ancient magic weaves through every corner of the land. In this solo tabletop RPG, you are the hero. Will you uncover the secrets of the Grail? Defend Camelot from the looming Saxon threat? Or navigate the treacherous court intrigues that could tear the kingdom apart?         
            </p>
            <p>
                Forge your destiny with nothing more than a few dice and your imagination. Every decision brings you closer to glory—or peril. Face legendary foes like the fearsome Red Welsh Dragon, match wits with cunning sorcerers, and uncover enchanted relics hidden in forgotten ruins. But beware: betrayal lurks behind every curtain, and even the mightiest knight can fall to temptation.
